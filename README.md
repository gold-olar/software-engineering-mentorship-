# software-engineering-mentorship-

My name is Olamide Samuel,  a student of the Obafemi Awolowo University. 
am a young inquisitive  developer  with  a  passion  for  learning  new  things.  I  am  enthusiastic  and  I  enjoy  taking  on  new  challenges  to develop  my  skills.

I see this mentorship as a guide to the path of becoming a very versatile and competent software engineer.

I hope to make it till the end of the program.
