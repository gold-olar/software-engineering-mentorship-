# PHASE 2 SUBMISSION

# Question 1.1 answer

I dont really think this is much of a mathematical problem,  i just think the students did not really have to have been thinking of when the tests were supposed to hold, but rather prepare for it since the test could be given at any day. I do not see anything wrong with their thinking either, as I think it is typical of the regular human.



# Question 1.2 answer
c) I believe the theorem was stated for only right angled triangles and as such, the rule does not apply to an equilateral triangle.

d)- the hypotenus of the triangle is the longest side of the triangle and it serves as the diagonal of a square when the rearragement is made
 - 





# Question 1.3 answer
a) on the LHS, it started of with a 1 and on the RHS it ended with a -1 and clearly in my mathematics, according to the number line, 1 != -1. 


b) No idea..

c) No idea ...



# Question 1.4 answer

a) finding the log of (1/2) base 10 gives a negative number, so going on with the calculation normally, If you multiply an inequality sign by a negative sign,You are supposed to change the sign.

b) This is really confusing, because clearly 1c is not even equal to 1$ but following the proof, there is no error at all.
so i think i have no idea where the bug is either.


c)the error has to be on the 4th line, dividing both sides by (a - b) which is 0 is actually mathematically impossible....


# Question 1.5 answer
No idea ...






# Question 1.6 answer
As stated earlier in the answer for 1.1, it was not a mathematical problem and i came to this conclusion because the question had to do with the state of minds of the students. i even feel strongly that its more associated to psychology.
